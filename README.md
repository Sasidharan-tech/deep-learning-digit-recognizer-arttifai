Handwritten Digit Recognizer using deep learning with CNN and Tkinter GUI, built during my internship at Arttifai Tech.

ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning

This project is a digit recognition system built with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset. It includes a Tkinter-based GUI that allows users to draw digits and receive real-time predictions. The model is built using TensorFlow and achieves high accuracy on handwritten digits (0â€“9).

ðŸ”§ Features

1 CNN model trained on MNIST
2 GUI for drawing digits (Tkinter)
3 Real-time digit prediction
4 Model saved as `model.h5`

ðŸš€ Technologies Used

1 Python
2 TensorFlow / Keras
3 Tkinter
4 NumPy, Pillow
