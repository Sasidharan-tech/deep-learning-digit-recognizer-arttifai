## Handwritten Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning
This project is a digit recognition system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on the MNIST dataset. It features a GUI built with Tkinter that allows users to draw digits and receive real-time predictions. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and achieves high accuracy in recognizing handwritten digits from 0 to 9.


## Features

- CNN model trained on MNIST dataset
- GUI for drawing digits (Tkinter-based)
- Real-time digit prediction
- Model saved as model.h5


## Tech Stack

- Python TensorFlow / Keras
- Tkinter 
- NumPy 
- Pillow


## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Sasidharan-tech/deep-learning-digit-recognizer-arttifai.git
  cd digit-recognizer
```
install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy opencv-python pillow matplotlib
```
Train the model:
```bash
python model_train.py
```
This will generate a file named model.h5 containing the trained CNN.

Run the GUI app:
```bash
python gui_app.py
```
## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  python gui_app.py
```
